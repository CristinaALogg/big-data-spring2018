# Problem Set 0: "Hello World" - Setup a Github Homepage

This problem set is designed to get you started with Git and Github pages. You will set up a website and become a bit more familiar with Github. For your deliverable, you are going to create a simple static website that says "Hello World." If you feel so inclined, go ham - you want!

`On the assignment tab of the course Stellar website, submit the link to your Github page.`

### 1. Create your github.io page

Following the instructions found in Part 1 of the in-class tutorial, create your Github homepage. On this page, include at least the following:

1. A heading with your name
2. Paragraph containing a short text bio or introduction
3. An image and link to a visualization project you find inspiring

This is your Github homepage that you can use as your own website. You can set this up however you like, and can take it with you after you leave MIT. In class, we will revisit this page later in the course when we work to expand our knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; ultimately, you can use it to host your final project. You can then customize it further, add more content, and do some design and styling.

Use this exercise to get all of the software and tools (i.e., Github, Atom, Python) installed and running on your machine.

Next week, we will **DIVE INTO PYTHON!**

### 2. Clone your copy of the Course Github Repository

For next week, you want your own copy of the course Github repo. Once you have completed setup, clone a copy of the course repository into your own Github folder on your machine.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ericmhuntley/big-data-spring2018.git
```

Next week, we will add more materials for the course, and you can pull them into your remote repository.
