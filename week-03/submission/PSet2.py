## Problem 1: Create a Bar Chart of Total Pings by Date

###Your first task is to create a bar chart (not a line chart!) of the total count of GPS pings, collapsed by date. You'll have to use `.groupby` to collapse your table on the grouping variable and choose how to aggregate the `count` column. Your code should specify a color for the bar chart and your plot should have a title. Check out the [Pandas Visualization documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/visualization.html) for some guidance regarding what parameters you can customize and what they do.

### Step 1 - Collapse by Date via groupby
date_count = df.groupby('date_new')['count'].sum()

#Show summary statistics by date
date_count.describe()

#Draft bar chart of pings (count) by date (date), Label Title and axes.
figure = date_count.plot.bar(title="Total GPS Pings by Date", color='blue')
figure.set_xlabel("Date")
figure.set_ylabel("Number of Pings")

##Your second task is to further clean the data. While we've successfully cleaned our data in one way (ridding it of values that are outside the 24-hour window that correspond to a given day of the week) it will be helpful to restructure our `hour` column in such a way that hours are listed in a more familiar 24-hour range. To do this, you'll want to more or less copy the structure of the code we used to remove data from hours outside of a given day's 24-hour window. You'll then want to use the [DataFrame's `replace` method](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.replace.html). Note that you can use lists in both `to_replace` and `value`.

for i in range(0, 168, 24):
  j = range(0,168,1)[i - 5]
  if (j > i):
    df.drop(df[
    (df['weekday'] == (i/24)) &
        (
            ( (df['hour'] < j) & (df['hour'] > i + 18) ) |
            ( (df['hour'] > i + 18 ) & (df['hour'] < j) )
            )
    ].index, inplace = True)
  else:
    df.drop(df[
    (df['weekday'] == (i/24)) &
    (
    (df['hour'] < j) | (df['hour'] > i + 18 )
    )
    ].index, inplace = True)
